## Implementation plan:

Below follows a list of things to do. As they get done, they will be checked off.

Types
---
    [x] Transfer Function

        [x] Constructors
        [x] Printing
        [x] Addition
        [x] Subtraction
        [x] Multiplication
        [x] Division
            -NOTE: Currently division by MIMO TransferFunctions isn't supported. 
            However, this is the current state with python-control as well. 
            With addition of LU-Decomposition for numeric types without pivoting,
            (in the works), this will be supported.
