Control Systems Toolbox for Julia
====
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vtjnash/Polynomial.jl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jcrist/Control.jl)

This is an implementation of a control systems toolbox, such as those found
in Matlab, Octave, or Python. Some functionality requires the use of `SLICOT`,
which has a Julia wrapper found at [Slicot.jl](https://github.com/jcrist/Slicot.jl).
Note that neither of these libraries are currently mature, but development is
active, and should be usable shortly! Check the [status page](https://github.com/jcrist/Control.jl/blob/master/status.md) 
for an up to date list of what's been implemented.
